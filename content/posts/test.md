I build my first website a long time ago and I remember that at that time it was impossible to find a well written blog post or a guide to build a website. Everything article was very bad written (at leat in Italian, my mother tongue).

Today I write this blog post that, I hope, will help you at least to understand the basic of this word that can change literally your life. In fact, if you have a local shop, with a proper website you can radically change the way and the amount of your sells. Even if your job has nothing to do with an online activity, you can radically change your life and the way you look at this strange word, I assure this.

To build a website and make it available online you need, basically, two things:

* a web server (that is the place that host your website)
* some code and a graphic theme (that are the tings that make your website work)
