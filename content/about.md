Hi, I'm Francesco Pistore and I'm a student of the MSc Finance in Venice, Italy.

Of course this has nothing to do with my jobs.. well. Here I have some space to explain what happened in the last years that brought me here.

## My passion for photography

In 2006, at the age of 14, I received my first pocket camera. I started to make some photos but I noticed some years later, that I was doing more vlog than photos... well, it could sound normal right now, but I can tell you that during first 2000s was very strange!

Anyway, after 5 years, during 2011, my mom decided to jump from her historical (but beautiful) analog camera to a new DSLR.. and what DSLR! It was a beautiful Nikon D90 with a stock 18-55mm.

I was shocked about that beauty and everytime my dad went to a motorsport event I took with me also my mom's D90.

I started to photograph rallies since my early ages. However only with the D90 I understood that a good camera with a good lens (even if stock) was the basic to do great photos.

I also started to travel a lot, first with my parents along Europe with a camper and later with my girlfriend [Greta](https://gretaas.im/). We took more or less 30 planes in just 4 years. Also Greta loves to photograph, especially people and street photography.

I don't know how many photos I took during the lasts years, but I'm sure that I improved my skills and I've a lot of work to do in the future to improve them again and again.

## My passion for Internet

_What about my passion for the web?_ It all started during my first two years of high school. I had a friend from India that was very good in making websites.

I started to improve my skills and I published my first website, pistonet, during 2009 a the age of 17.

But I jumped in a new world (for me) only during 2012, when I discover WordPress, its plugins, its themes and, most of all, the SEO.

I started [Stintup.com](https://www.stintup.com/) and it was my job during universities years. Thanks to Stintup I traveled a lot, both for business reasons and just for passion. I visited more than 25 countries, I achieved press membership in MWC Barcelona, Geneva International Motor Show, AME Padua, EXPO 2015 and many other events.

**Now I just want to share with you my experience, building a nice and fast website that can help you to achieve your next objectives too**.

## What I do here with franzpisto.com?

franzpisto.com is just my professional website. I used to call me franzpisto all over in the web, so I decided to call my personal website with this name.

I offer especially two services:

1. \[Web services](https://franzpisto.com/web-services/ "Web services") (making them, manage them, support you)
2. \[Photo services](https://franzpisto.com/photo-services/ "Photo services") 
    (I take photo of your products and your business and make them better).

_Thank You for reading!_
