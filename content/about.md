Hi, I'm Francesco Pistore, I graduated in a MSc Finance in Venice, Italy and actually I work for an investment company as an Intern Business Analyst with a Global Investment Platform (SimCorp Dimension) inside the Competence Center team.

Here I have some space to explain what happened in the last years that brought me here. If you have questions feel free to send me a message via the contact form! :)

## My passion for photography and travel

In **2006**, at the age of 14, I received my **first pocket camera**.

After 5 years, during **2011**, my mom decided to jump from her historical (but beautiful) analog camera to a new DSLR.. and what DSLR! It was a beautiful **Nikon D90** with a stock 18-105mm. I was shocked about that beauty and everytime my dad went to a motorsport event I took with me also my mom's D90.

I started to photograph **rallies** since my early ages. However only with the D90 I understood that a good camera with a good lens (even if stock) was the basic to do great photos.

I also started to **travel** a lot, firstly with my parents along Europe with a camper and later with my girlfriend [Greta](https://gretaas.im/). We took more or less 30 planes in just 4 years and only for travel (not job neither study) reasons. Also Greta loves to photograph, especially people and street photography.

I don't know how many photos I took during the lasts years, but I'm sure that I improved my skills and I've a lot of work to do in the future to improve them again and again. And I nearly satured 2x2TB HDD.

Psst.. I'm also a:

* **Certified EASA Enac APR pilot for OPEN A1-A3 categories**
* **Google Local Guide**

## My passion for Internet and development

*What about my passion for the web?* It all started during my first two years of high school. I had a friend from India that was very good with computers.

I started to improve my skills and I published my first website, **pistonet**, during **2009** at the age of 17.

But I jumped in a new world (for me) only during **2012**, when I discover **WordPress**, its plugins, its themes and, most of all, the **SEO**.

I started **[Stintup.com](https://www.stintup.com/)** and it was my job during universities years. Thanks to Stintup I traveled a lot, both for business reasons and just for passion. I visited more than 25 countries, I achieved press membership in MWC Barcelona, Geneva International Motor Show, AMDE Padua, EXPO 2015 and many other international events.

Actually I offer these services given my over 8-years experience:

1. **Copywriting: I write article, blog posts, review and how-to's SEO-ready for you**
2. **I can build a nice and fast website for you**

## My studies and the passion for Finance

My studies have nothing to do with what you read up to here. In fact, after a **Bachelor's degree in Economics and Management**, I took a **Master of Science in Finance** in **2020** (held completely in english but based in Venice, Italy). On the same day, I was hired by an **investment company** for an Intern **Business Analyst** position. Essentially I work with big data and database, in particular I do: data extraction, data setup and modification and portfolio calculation. Team: Global Investment Platform - SimCorp Dimension Competence Center.

I have a big passion for **financial markets** since 2013, when I started trading and investing at the age of 20. Some years later I discovered the magic world of **FinTech**, where my two big passion of IT and finance come together! Only during 2017 I started to study cryptocurrencies and the technology behind it (blockchain) and some months later I started investing in Bitcoin.
