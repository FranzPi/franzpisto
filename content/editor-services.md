I started my "career" on the web when I open my first website *pistonet* at the age of 17 during 2009. It was a very simple website built with a program. No code needed and the SEO was not in my vocabulary yet.

After 3 years and a bunch of websites later, I opened *Stintup.com*. It is actually my main website and the one which gives me the possibilities to partecipate at different events where I met many interesting people that shared with me their tips and secrets of this strange world.

I started to study and improve my skills and month by month I started to see the first results. Thanks to a good SEO my blog posts are read every day by more than 1,000 people with a peak of near 2,000 people during some days.

I also started to improve the basics of digital marketing, especially regarding:

* **affiliate marketing**
* **content marketing**
* **Advertising**
